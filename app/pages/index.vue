    <p>SOC Training Portfolio</p>
     <p class="text-muted text-justify">
      I built this portfolio to document my hands-on journey toward becoming a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst. Each module card below represents a specific area of SOC training that I personally studied, practiced, and applied through labs, simulations, and real-world–style scenarios.

Rather than focusing only on theory, my training emphasizes how SOC analysts actually work—from detecting suspicious activity, analyzing logs, investigating alerts, to making informed response decisions.

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to think like a defender, understand attacker behavior, and apply structured analysis using industry-standard frameworks and tools.
